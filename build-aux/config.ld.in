# Gradual Function Type Checking

A Luaish run-time gradual type checking system, for argument and return
types at function boundaries with simple annotations that can be disabled
in production code.  Its API and type mismatch errors are modelled on the
core Lua C-language `argcheck ()` API.

This is a light-weight library for Lua 5.1 (including LuaJIT), 5.2
and 5.3 written in pure Lua.

## LICENSE

The code is copyright by its author, and released under the MIT
license (the same license as Lua itself).  There is no warranty.
